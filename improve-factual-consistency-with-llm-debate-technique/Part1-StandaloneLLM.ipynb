    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we navigate the LLM debating technique with more persuasive LLMs having two expert debater LLMs (Claude and Mixtral) and one judge (using Claude - we can use others like Mistral/Mixtral, Titan Premier) to measure, compare and contrast its performance against other techniques like self-consistency (with naive and expert judges) and LLM consultancy. This notebook is an adapted and partial implementation of one of the ICML 2024 best papers, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06782\"> Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers </a> on a new and different Amazon Science evaluation dataset <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/tofueval\">TofuEval</a>. \n",

    "    While this notebook(part 1, 2 and 3) compares various methods and demonstrates the efficacy of LLM Debates in notebook part 3 with a supervised dataset, the greater benefit is possible in unsupervised scenarios where ground truth is unknown and ground truth alignment and/or curation is required. Human annotation can be expensive plus slow and agreement amongst human annotators adds another level of intricacy. A possible `scalable oversight direction could be this LLM debating technique to align on the ground truth options` via this debating and critique mechanism by establishing factual consistency(veracity). This alignment and curation of ground truth for unsupervised data could be a possible win direction for the debating technique in terms of cost versus benefit analysis.\n",

    "## Use-Case Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the measurement and improvement of factual consistency (veracity) with explainability in this notebook, we conduct a series of experiments to choose the best summary for each transcript. In each experiment, we measure the veracity and correctness of the summaries generated from transcripts and improve upon the decision to choose the correct one via methods like LLM consultancy and LLM debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>overall task in this notebook</b> is choose which one of the two summaries is most appropriate for a given transcript. There are a total of 10 transcripts and each transcript has 2 summaries - one correct and other incorrect. The incorrect summaries have various classes of errors like `Nuanced Meaning Shift`, `Extrinsic Information` and  `Reasoning errors`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will conduct the following set of experiment combinations to measure, compare and contrast LLM debating techniques with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "For each of these experiments we flip the side of the argument the LLM takes to account for `position bias` and `verbosity bias` and re-run each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** We always use the same Judge LLM (Mistral 7B) across all the experiments in this notebook\n",

The first summary talks about North Korea's plan to launch a satellite and the US's suspicion of it being a cover for missile testing. The second summary discusses diplomatic efforts to secure the release of American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. There is no direct conflict between the two summaries, but they do not provide any factual information that directly supports each other.<br><br>Given the task to choose the answer that is most factually consistent, it is important to consider the information provided in each summary and whether it is factually accurate. Both summaries are based on reported news, so it is reasonable to assume that they contain some level of factual information. However, without further context or specific details, it is difficult to definitively determine which summary is more factually consistent than the other.<br><br>Final Answer: It is impossible to determine which answer is more factually consistent based on the information provided.<br><br>Answer Text: It is impossible to determine which answer is more factually consistent based on the information provided.</td>\n",
