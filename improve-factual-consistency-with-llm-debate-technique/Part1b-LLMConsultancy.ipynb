    "In this notebook, we navigate the LLM debating technique with more persuasive LLMs having two expert debater LLMs (Claude and Mixtral) and one judge (using Claude - we can use others like Mistral/Mixtral, Titan Premier) to measure, compare and contrast its performance against other techniques like self-consistency (with naive and expert judges) and LLM consultancy. This notebook is an adapted and partial implementation of one of the ICML 2024 best papers, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06782\"> Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers </a> on a new and different Amazon Science evaluation dataset <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/tofueval\">TofuEval</a>. \n",

    "    While this notebook(part 1,2 and 3) compares various methods and demonstrates the efficacy of LLM Debates in notebook part 3 with a supervised dataset, the greater benefit is possible in unsupervised scenarios where ground truth is unknown and ground truth alignment and/or curation is required. Human annotation can be expensive plus slow and agreement amongst human annotators adds another level of intricacy. A possible `scanotebookle oversight direction could be this LLM debating technique to align on the ground truth options` via this debating and critique mechanism by establishing factual consistency(veracity). This alignment and curation of ground truth for unsupervised data could be a possible win direction for the debating technique in terms of cost versus benefit analysis.\n",

    "## Use-Case Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the measurement and improvement of factual consistency (veracity) with explainability in this notebook, we conduct a series of experiments to choose the best summary for each transcript. In each experiment, we measure the veracity and correctness of the summaries generated from transcripts and improve upon the decision to choose the correct one via methods like LLM consultancy and LLM debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>overall task in this notebook</b> is choose which one of the two summaries is most appropriate for a given transcript. There are a total of 10 transcripts and each transcript has 2 summaries - one correct and other incorrect. The incorrect summaries have various classes of errors like `Nuanced Meaning Shift`, `Extrinsic Information` and  `Reasoning errors`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will conduct the following set of experiment combinations to measure, compare and contrast LLM debating techniques with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "For each of these experiments we flip the side of the argument the LLM takes to account for `position bias` and `verbosity bias` and re-run each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** We always use the same Judge LLM (Mistral 7B) across all the experiments in this notebook\n",

    "We use Claude as consultancy for both sides of the answers separately and then take the average of both the experiments 3a and 3b as final accuracy. This continues for N(=3 in this notebook) rounds. This accounts for errors due to position (choosing an answer due to its order/position) and verbosity bias (one answer longer than the other)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Experiment 3a: (LLM consultancy for Answer A): \n",
    "Claude v3(Sonnet) acting as a consultant always picks Answer A(Ground Truth:False Answer) and shares rationale why that answer is correct. This continues for N(=3 in this notebook) rounds.

    "Claude v3(Sonnet) acting as a consultant always picks Answer B(Ground Truth:True Answer) and generates rationale why that answer is correct. This continues for N(=3 in this notebook) rounds.

    "For each type of experiment we evaluate the accuracy of the answers for that experiment/method type to compare and contrast each method at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final experiment on LLM Debate, we also calculate the `win rate` of the LLM debaters to evaluate which of the LLMs actually got most of the answers right as adjudicated by the judge. This can be considered a mechanism to choose one LLM over the other given this use-case.\n",

However, the consultant's interpretation of these actions as ballistic missile tests is not explicitly stated in the quote and is an assumption.<br>2. Based on the information provided, it seems that both summaries could be factually consistent with the story.

       "      <td>&lt;thinking&gt;<br>The consultant's arguments consistently emphasize the significance of currency uncertainty as a major issue in the event of Scottish independence. They provide quotes from Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff to support their claims. The quotes are verified, making them trustworthy. The consultant argues that there is no clear plan for what currency Scotland would use, creating immense uncertainty that would unnerve markets and investors. This currency issue is linked to the broader negative impact of independence on Scotland's economy in the short-term. Based on the evidence presented, I believe the consultant's summary is the most factually consistent one.<br>&lt;/thinking&gt;<br>Answer: A: Currency uncertainty would be a major issue in the event of a yes vote in the Scotland referendum on independence.<br><br>Final Answer: A.</td>\n",
