CNN-104129,"DOBBS: General Motors today announced it will offer early retirement buyouts for 113,000 of its employees. Management calls it, quote, ""accelerated attrition,"" end quote. And it is only the latest sign of the dramatic decline of the American automobile industry and the continued assault on working men and women in this country. General Motors reporting a $10.6 billion loss in 2005. The company continues to lose market share. Hourly employees will be eligible for lump sum payments of up to as much as $140,000 depending on years of service. Bankrupt auto parts supplier Delphi also offer a buyout to 13,000 employees who can receive up to $35,000. General Motors hoping that these buyouts will help it meet its goal of cutting 30,000 jobs by 2008. Ford also planning to eliminate 30,000 jobs, Daimler Chrysler has a goal of 40,000 jobs. General Motors negotiated the terms of the buyout with the United Auto Workers Union. Employees will have up to 52 days to accept or reject the offers. Consumers personal information is a billion-dollar business for data brokers and marketers in this country. Now the Internal Revenue Service believes the information in your tax return should be for sale, to them. And for the first time, it wants to allow accountants and tax preparation companies such as H&R; Block to sell your personal information. Lisa Sylvester reports.
LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Your tax returns are in many ways a map of your entire life. How much you make, your medical cost, charitable donations. It's all there. An Internal Revenue Service proposal would allow tax preparers to sell that information to marketing companies and data brokers.
BETH GIVENS, PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE: I think this is a shockingly bad idea, to allow tax preparers to sell these very sensitive documents. The information contained tells a lot about us, about our families.
SYLVESTER: The IRS ironically claims that its doing this to improve consumer protections. The agency argues that it would require consent before tax returns could be sent overseas for processing or disclosed to third parties. In a statement, the IRS commissioner said, ""The heart of this proposed regulation is about the right of taxpayers to control their tax return information."" But many consumers could unwittingly sign away their privacy.
PETER SWIRE, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: The permission here is fake permission. The accountant sets all the little tabs out there and little red tabs and says sign here in all these places. And then you sign the consent and your record is now being sold to a database company.
SYLVESTER: It's hard to see why consumers would want to have their information sold.
BETH MCCONNELL, PENN. PIRG: I think it's incredibly significant, not only given the epidemic of identity theft that affects more than 9 million Americans every single year, but also just the barrage of marketing and advertising that consumers are already having a hard time controlling.
SYLVESTER: Consumer groups say for individuals, there's nothing to gain by having their records sold and everything to lose.
SYLVESTER: H&R; Block did not return our calls for comment on this story. And there's a real sense that the IRS was trying to fly this one in under the radar. It called the change not a significant regulatory action, although most taxpayers would probably beg to differ, Lou.
DOBBS: Well, it is under the heading of, you can't make this stuff up. The Internal Revenue Service saying that we would be sharing our personal tax information to protect the privacy of our tax information. It's Orwellian. It's breathtaking and we thank you, Lisa Sylvester. A reminder now to vote in our poll. Do you believe as members of the Bush administration claim, that the media is to blame for the rising public opposition to the war in Iraq? Cast your vote at LouDobbs.com, please. We'll have the results for you coming up here shortly. Also ahead, another look at your thoughts and then God and politics. The Catholic Church and its controversial stance on illegal immigration and federal legislation. I'll be joined by one of the church's influential priest, who says illegal immigrants are needed here to fill those jobs that Americans just won't do. You're heard that language before. We'll be talking about whether that is truly the case and whether the Catholic Church should be so heavily invested in this issue. Stay with us."
CNN-138971,"ROBERTS: Welcome back to the Most News in the Morning. You've seen their faces. The two American journalists captured and accused of spying in North Korea. And within hours, they are set to go on trial. The sister of one of the journalists, reporter Lisa Ling from CNN's ""PLANET IN PERIL"" series has pleaded for their release. Our Jason Carroll here now with what a trial in North Korea could mean. And by any stretch of the imagination, it's got to be a frightening prospect.
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And this has been so -- this has been such a terrifying ordeal, not only for the two women who are involved but for the families as well. If the trial proceeds and there is a conviction, they could be looking at an independent sentence at a prison or a labor camp. One of the many problems here is so little is known about North Korea, let alone the country's legal system. What is known, a fair trial is not likely.
CARROLL (voice-over): Trapped in one of the most isolated countries in the world, North Korea, imprisoned, accused of spying and awaiting trial. This is what American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee are facing. Their families pleading for their release saying both women are terrified.
LISA LING, SISTER OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: They never meant to cross into North Korea. I mean, that was never their objective. And if for some reason they may have, then we are sorry. And we hope that the North Korean government will show mercy.
CARROLL: Lisa Ling received a surprise call from her sister last Tuesday saying she was being treated fairly. Ling who is also a journalist has reported from North Korea for ""National Geographic"" and knows just how dangerous the country can be.
LING: How does the great leader defend it against big powers like America.
CARROLL: With his wife's trial just one day away, Laura Ling's husband said the strain has been unbearable.
IAIN CLAYTON, HUSBAND OF KIDNAPPED JOURNALIST: As you can imagine, it's probably been, you know, the worst few months of my life.
CARROLL: Both Ling and Lee are reporters for ""Current TV,"" a media venture started by former Vice President Al Gore. They were reporting on North Korean defectors living along the China-North Korea border when they were taken into custody on March 17. The North Korean government claiming the two entered the country, illegally, a charge the State Department and Lisa Ling deny. In an interview on AMERICAN MORNING, former vice president says he'd even consider going to North Korea to help.
AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I would do anything within reason including that at the drop of the hat. But it is -- that's not -- it's not some place that you just buy a ticket and show up at the airport.
CARROLL: Complicating diplomacy, North Korea angered the world with recent nuclear test and missile launches. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is an expert on the region and has met the country's leader, Kim Jong-Il, and knows he will influence the trial's outcome.
WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER NORTH KOREA POLICY COORDINATOR: He understands how important family is to each other. And so I hope that he takes that understanding and releases these two young women and returns them to their families.
CARROLL: Victor Cha has also been to North Korea, the former director for Asian Affairs under George W. Bush says the country's legal system has little rhyme or reason.
VICTOR CHA, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CSIS KOREA CHAIR: I think what you would expect to see is something in between a prison sentence to, you know, perhaps even sentencing to some sort of labor camp. Hopefully, those will just be a token sort of punishment.
CARROLL: Again, the trial is set for Thursday. Representatives from Sweden have been working behind the scenes to try to engage the North Koreans. They're looking at what happened in the '90s when an American pilot accidentally flew over the region and was taken into custody. He was released after he promised to apologize.
ROBERTS: She had this ghost coming down hours from now. Jason, thanks so much. Don't miss ""AC360"" tonight, by the way. Lisa Ling and both journalists' husbands will be live with Anderson at a vigil, hoping for their release. That's on ""AC360"" tonight at 10:00 Eastern."
CNN-139946,"ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.
MALVEAUX: We want to go directly to Al Franken. He is Minnesota's new senator -- that declared today, after a very long and contentious race. Let's take a quick listen to Al Franken at the mike.
AL FRANKEN, WINNER OF MINNESOTA SENATE RACE: I'm thrilled and honored by the faith that Minnesotans have placed in me. I'm also humbled, not just by the closeness of this election, but by the enormity of the responsibility that comes with this office. We have a lot of work to do in Washington, but that's why I signed up for the job in the first place. When we started this campaign way back in February of 2007, I said that Americans have never backed away from tough challenges and Minnesotans have always led the way. Working with our fantastic senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, I'm going to fight hard to make quality health care accessible and affordable to all Minnesotans, to make sure that our kids have an education that prepares them for a 21st century economy, to make Minnesota the epicenter of a new, renewable energy economy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil, to restore our standing in the world and put people to work here at home. To those Minnesotans who worked for me, volunteered for me, voted for me, I can't tell you how grateful I am. When you win an election this close, you know that not one bit of effort went to waste. And to those who devoted their time and energy to supporting Senator Coleman, I can only imagine how hard these past months have been. But no matter whether you voted for me or for Senator Coleman or for Senator Barkley or whether you voted at all, I want the people of Minnesota to know that I'm ready to work for all of you, that I'm committed to being a voice for all Minnesotans in the U.S. Senate. I know there's been a lot of talk about the fact that when I'm sworn in, I'll be the 60th member of the Democratic Caucus. But that's -- that's not how I see it. The way I see it, I'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic senator, I'm going to Washington to be the second senator from the State of Minnesota. And that's how I'm going to do this job.
MALVEAUX: Minnesota's new senator, Al Franken, saying he is ready to go to work for his state. I want to bring in own Gloria Borger to kind of give us a lay of the land here. Obviously, it's a race that everybody has been following for quite some time. This is the next step now. What -- what does this mean for -- for the Democrats now that they have a larger majority?
GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it means that they've got 60 seats, which would give them a filibuster-proof majority. But that's assuming that Democrats, and two Independents who we include in that, would agree on everything which is, of course, a large assumption that is not necessarily true.
MALVEAUX: Sure.
BORGER: But, of course, they'll take every vote they can get at this point. Don't forget, this has been a hotly contested fight over these last eight months -- very divisive, splitting the parties in the Senate, leaving the State of Minnesota unrepresented. And so I think that a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are kind of breathing a sigh of relief that it's -- that it's finally over, no matter how it was decided.
MALVEAUX: Do you think it helps the Obama administration and the president pushing forward some of the things that have been so difficult for him, whether it's energy or health care?
BORGER: Sure.
MALVEAUX: Obviously...
BORGER: Yes. Sure. I think it does. I mean, look, a vote is a vote is a vote. And I think Al Franken's politics are clearly more on the liberal side. So he would be more likely to go along with Barack Obama on things like climate change, on things like health care reform, than somebody like Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who's much more of a moderate who he may lose on certain votes.
MALVEAUX: Sure.
BORGER: So I think that they would look at Franken as much more dependable.
MALVEAUX: OK. Gloria Borger making sense of all of this. Thank you so much.
BORGER: Sure.
MALVEAUX: One of Michael Jackson's prized acquisitions was the rights to a vast Beatles music library. Well, what is -- what will happen to that practically priceless catalog now? Iranian leaders say the election is confirmed and they will tolerate no more protests. But what happens to those arrested during the uprising? Will their families ever see them again?"
CNN-145383,"HARRIS: And President Obama in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building now highlighting several initiatives this morning to boost science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and Secretary Steven Chu, who is our energy secretary. They are both doing outstanding work each and every day. I want to acknowledge Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is from Texas. And she is one of the members of our Science and Technology Committee and doing outstanding work. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden is in the house. Where's Charlie?
OBAMA: And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators. And that's why education in math and science is so important. Now, the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around their world. And this isn't news. We've seen warring statistics like this for years. Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress. And time and again as a nation, we've let our children down. So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world. It's time for all of us in Washington and across America to take responsibility for our future. And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. To meet the goal, the Recovery Act included the largest investment in education in history, while preventing hundreds of thousands of educators from being fired because of state budget shortfalls. Under the outstanding leadership of Arne Duncan, we've launched a $4 billion Race to the Top fund, one of the largest investments in education reform in history. And through the Race to the Top, states won't just be receiving funding; they'll have to compete for funding. And in this competition, producing the most innovative programs in math and science will be an advantage. In addition, we are challenging states to improve achievement by raising standards, using data to better inform decisions and take new approaches to turn around struggling schools. And because a great teacher is the single most important factor in a great education, we're asking states to focus on teacher effectiveness and to make it possible for professionals, like many of the people in this room, to bring their experience and enthusiasm into the classroom. But you are here because you know that the success we seek is not going to be attained by government alone. It depends on the dedication of students and parents and the commitment of private citizens, organizations and companies. It depends on all of us. And that's why, back in April, at the National Academy of Sciences, I issued a challenge: to encourage folks to think of new and creative ways of engaging young people in science and engineering. And we are here because the leaders in this room answered that call to action. Today we are launching the Educate to Innovate Campaign, a nationwide effort to help reach the goal this administration has set: moving to the top in science and math education in the next decade. We've got leaders from private companies and universities, foundations and nonprofits and organizations representing millions of scientists, engineers and teachers from across America.
OBAMA: The initial commitment of the private sector to this campaign is more than $260 million, and we only expect the campaign to grow. Business leaders from Intel, Xerox, Kodak and Time Warner Cable are teaming up with Sally Ride and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the Carnegie Corporation, to find and replicate successful science, math and technology programs all across America. ""Sesame Street"" has become a two-year initiative to teach young kids about math and science, and Discovery Communications is going to deliver interactive science content to 60,000 schools, reaching 35 million students. These efforts extend beyond the classroom. Time Warner Cable is joining with the Coalition for Science After School and FIRST Robotics, the program created by inventor Dean Kamen, which gave us the Cougar Cannon to connect 1 million students with fun after-school activities like robotics competitions. The MacArthur Foundation and industry leaders like Sony are launching a nationwide challenge to design compelling, freely available science-related video games. And organizations representing teachers, scientists, mathematicians and engineers, joined by volunteers in the community, are participating in a grassroots effort called National Lab Day to reach 10 million young people with hands-on learning. Students will launch rockets, construct miniature windmills and get their hands dirty. They'll have the chance to build and create, and maybe destroy just a little bit...
OBAMA: Now, I have to say to the young people who are here, we can't let students off the hook. In the end, the success of this campaign depends on them. But I believe strongly that America's young people will rise to the challenge if given the opportunity, and given a little bit of a push. We've got to work together to create these opportunities because our future depends on them. And I just want to mention the importance not only for students but also of parents. You know, I was in Asia, I think, many of you are aware, for a week. And I was having lunch with the president of South Korea, President Lee. And I was interested in the education policy -- they've grown enormously over the last 40 years -- and I asked them what are the biggest challenges in your education policy. He said, you know, ""The biggest challenge that I have is that my parents are too demanding."""
CNN-164885,"FEYERICK: We'll get to Donald Trump's campaign stump in just a second, but first a look at his marital status. How many wives? There were three. Ivanna, they had three children together. Then, of course, there was Marla Maples, the other woman. They had a daughter. And the last, he's currently married to Milania Trump. They have a son together. Now to the mogul's political aspirations - Trump is scheduled to speak at this Tea Party rally in Boca Raton, Florida. He'll bring his comments to you. Trump is considering running for president. He's expected to make a final decision by June. Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may be on the move. An army spokesman tells CNN Mubarak was transferred from a hospital in Sharm el Sheikh to a military facility in Cairo. Several riot police standing guard outside the hospital say Mubarak is still there. The former president is under investigation for the deaths of protesters during the recent uprising. Government forces are pounding Libya's third largest city with rockets. Rebels say Gadhafi troops shelled a neighborhood, killing three people. It comes one day after a human rights group claims government forces fired cluster bombs into civilian areas. And at least five NATO service members and four Afghan soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. The bomber was wearing an Afghan national army uniform. In Cuba this weekend, it's national celebration and an important gathering of the communist government. CNN's Shasta Darlington was in Havana today, and you had watched this huge military parade 50 years after the invasion of the Bay of Pigs, really interesting historically.
SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Deb. This was a massive celebration of Cuba's past victories. We saw tanks rumbling through revolution plaza, tighter jets flying overhead. Thousands of troops and civilians, people from the neighborhoods coming out and marching in support of their revolution and in celebration of these major victories. It was 50 years ago this small Caribbean island defeated a U.S.-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs. It was led by Cuban exiles, but it was really considered a defeat for Washington. They failed to provide air support. And of course Cubans never rose up and joined in the fight. A major victory, of course, for Cuba. This afternoon we'll see, as you mentioned, he was going to start looking for the future. The leaders will meet behind closed doors for a four-day meeting of the communist party. In fact, it's the first Congress of the communist party in nearly 14 years. They're going to focus on the economy and needed reforms there. President Raul Castro has called for more private enterprise and less of a role from the state. They want to do major layoffs in the state sector and allow more people to get into business for themselves in things like plumbing, gardening, opening up restaurants. They'll also talk property ownership, which could mean Cubans for the first time in decades could buy and sell homes and possibly even all those old cars could be affected if they allow Cubans to buy and sell more modern vehicles, Deb.
FEYERICK: Shasta, I read something like 170,000 Cubans have actually taken out licenses to open their own business. Very quickly, why 14 years? Are communists coming from elsewhere? Is this an internal meeting of the leaders there in Cuba?
DARLINGTON: Deb, it's a good question. They should be holding these meetings every five years. We haven't had one since 1997. Part of the disruption was, of course, when Fidel Castro fell ill, there was the transition from one government to another. Then massive hurricanes sort of hit the economy, global crisis, lots of different reasons. But they couldn't wait any longer. This is probably the first Congress solely dedicated to economic reform and the time is right. They knew they had to do something, and president Raul Castro has already called for many of these reforms. They're hoping to get even more done once they ever got the leaders together.
FEYERICK: We will be keeping an eye on it, Shasta Darlington in Cuba. Thank you so much. R&B; singer usher gives his all on stage. When he's not performing, he's giving back to the community through his new look foundation. He explains how in this ""Impact your World.""

CNN-173359,"LEMON: The trial of Dr. Conrad Murray gets underway on Monday. Murray's been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthesia Propofol and other drugs. To find out what affects these drugs had, I spoke to a doctor who saw Jackson's autopsy report. His name is Dr. Zeev Cain. He is the head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine.
LEMON: You saw the toxicology report?
DR. ZEEV CAIN, DIRECTOR, ANESTHESIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE: I saw the toxicology repot. I saw the autopsy report.
LEMON: You did?
CAIN: I did.
LEMON: What was in Michael Jackson's system?
CAIN: Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol.
LEMON: That's a lot.
CAIN: That's a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs.
LEMON: Enough to kill someone?
CAIN: Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes.
LEMON: Yes. What did the autopsy report show?
CAIN: Well, overall, Michael Jackson was actually in good health. There was no real problems in his internal organs. It did show, at some point in the past, he did use drugs but, again, overall, he was in excellent health.
LEMON: What kind of drugs?
CAIN: You can't really say that. The only thing we can do is go based on what we found in his blood.
LEMON: OK. It didn't show one drug which the defense is saying he was addicted to. What I'm talking about,
CAIN: Absolutely true. There was no Demerol found there, which means he did not really take Demerol for 40 days before this.
LEMON: How many days would it have been in order for it to leave?
CAIN: Several days. Demerol actually has a pretty long half life. So it stays in the system quite a while.
LEMON: Yes. Were you surprised by anything in the report?
CAIN: I would say I was surprised by what in good shape he was. Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy.
LEMON: Yes. Yes. And to have those drugs, you said Lorazepam --
CAIN: Diazepam, Midazolam.
LEMON: All those drugs in there together -- does someone usually take all of those drugs together?
CAIN: You take them if you want to induce sedation or medically induced coma. Which brings me to the issue of Propofol should not be used in home settings.
LEMON: Yes.
CAIN: It should be used when you want to medially induce coma or sedation in a hospital. You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level. That's the bottom line.
LEMON: So, listen, people are -- this is going to be the issue now with medicine. How much can you get from doctors, depending on how much you pay? Your celebrity status? What you do for a living? All of that, is that at issue here?
CAIN: Absolutely, it is. Remember, they found four gallons. Four gallons are enough to put to sleep about 500 people. Or it is enough to keep somebody asleep for eight hours for almost two months. Now, that may be a bit misleading, because he may have built resistance in his body already. We have to remember, when somebody does take Propofol on a regular basis, they will build up resistance. So I know some reports say it is a two-months supply. It depends how much resistance was in his body. It may only be a one week supply. We don't know.
LEMON: Is there something we should be concerned about? I heard during the testimony that it is usually a doctor/patient relationship, and maybe this was an employee/employer relationship. Is that a concern to society overall in this case and in society, this culture where you see drugs on television and what have you?
CAIN: To my opinion, there is a fundamental difference in the Western society versus other societies in the relations between doctor/patient. I think we need to go back to the basics and say doctors are here to take care of patients. It's not a question of you paying me for something. We are not the same as lawyers, to my opinion. We are doctors. Our first sworn duty is to take care of you. Money is secondary. We really need to take care your well being, regardless of how much you will pay for me.
LEMON: Thank you, doctor.
CAIN: You're welcome.
LEMON: Dr. Zeev Cain. My thanks to him at the University of California, Irvine. Stay with CNN. There's more ahead next hour on Dr. Murray's trial. Legal analyst, Holly Hughes, will join me to explain what we can expect when testimony resumes on Monday. Coming up, the return of skulls to the place they belong gives a morbid history lesson. The first time in the 20th century one nation tried to erase the existence of a people."
CNN-197627,"BLITZER: Connecticut state police confirm today, just a little while ago indeed, that Adam Lanza fired what they call hundreds of bullet, hundreds, at the Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday and you a number of weapons with him. We are live from the Lanza home, in just a moment with that investigation, standby for that. Also, we are awaiting the arrival of President Obama. He is due here in Newtown shortly. He is going to speak with the families of the 26 people, most of them elementary school children who were shot dead Friday morning. Stay with CNN for that. You will see the president live right here when he arrives. And of course, that interfaith vigil, the entirety, all of it we will bring it to you live. Let's go out to the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mother that home is also right now a crime scene because it appears in Lanza's mother was killed -- killed in the home before the shooting rampage over at the elementary school. CNN's Alison Kosik is joining us now from the Lanza home. Alison, the state police, Connecticut state police, they just gave us an update. For those of the viewers weren't watching CNN live, tell us the main points that the police made.
ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The state police say that Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother, shooting her multiple times inside the house that is in this neighborhood where I'm standing right now. Police still have the street leading up to his house blocked off. You know, there hasn't been much activity since yesterday afternoon, up until about -- I would say a little over an hour ago, we watched about six police cars drive up several officials got out of their car, talked a built and then got back in the cars and drove off, we assume to Adam Lanza's house. Now, what we did learn throughout the day from state police is that their focus is really was on this school. And what they found was that four weapons were found at the school, three were found in the classroom a shotgun was found in Lanza's car that was parked outside the school. We also learned that Lanza mostly used a semiautomatic weapon called a Bushmaster inside the school to kill those 26 people inside the school. He had, as you said, he shot dozens of bullets and he had hundreds of unused ammunition as well, hundreds of bullets that were not even used. So, it was clear why the medical examiner came out yesterday and explained how Adam Lanza shot those 26 people multiple times, some of them, he shot, said the medical examiner, three to 11 times. It's clear that Lanza carrying that much ammunition on him was looking to cause the most destruction and death - Wolf.
BLITZER: What a horrific, horrific crime. Alison, thank you so much. So, what happened Friday will make Monday, certainly, a huge challenge for so many families. Let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta who is here with us now. Posttraumatic stress disorder that is going to be a huge problem.
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And you know, we are used to talking about this in the context over adults but it can happen in children and it can happen quickly. I think that's two things people don't always realize. And you know, how the children behave now, how a lot of these things are implemented that you've been talking about with people over the last couple of days, is going to make a big difference, if certain conversations had had. If special care is taken to make sure that children are sleeping well, for example. They are going to be able to cope much better in the long runs. So, you can predict, you know, certain likelihood of success in terms of that coping by what's happening the next few days.
BLITZER: We think of posttraumatic stress disorder, troops coming home from Afghanistan or Iraq. This is obviously very different than that. But, what are the symptoms? What should we be looking forward to? This is a very serious illness.
GUPTA: In adults, you know, you think about things like hyper vigilance, difficulty sleeping, very quick and almost hasty reaction. In children, it can be very different. Sometimes don't verbalize it hard late all, changes in how they play. They may, in fact, start playing, you know, toy guns or something like that if they didn't before. They can have regression. So, a 6-year-old can start acting like a younger child, for example. And again, just paying attention to those things and not sort of glossing over, obviously don't want to provide graphic details, make sure you are having conversations. Tomorrow, kids go back to school. They don't know about what happened yet, they probably will by tomorrow.
BLITZER: I'm sure they will. And if their parents didn't tell them, teachers might tell them or their classmates would tell them.
GUPTA: Social media.
BLITZER: Yes. They will hear about. And Sanjay is going to be with us throughout the night. We are awaiting the president of the United States. He is coming here to Newtown to bring some comfort to the families, the first responders. Also, he will participate in the interfaith vigil that will be taking place here in Connecticut. Our coverage continues right after this."
CNN-201245,"SAMBOLIN: Welcome back. Fifteen minutes past the hour. We are following breaking news this morning. It is a shocking story involving the blade runner, Olympic and Paralympic track superstar Oscar Pistorius. He is at the police station in south Africa right now after his model girlfriend was shot and killed inside his home. Police are saying a 26-year-old man has been arrested. They are not confirming that it is Pistorius, although it is important to note that Pistorius is 26 years old. We are also finding out about previous incidents at his home of a domestic nature. Pistorius, who is a double amputee, reached the 400-meter semifinals in the London Games last year. He races with carbon blades because of a birth defect.
BERMAN: To New York now where first it was calorie counts on menus, then trans fats, then mega soft drinks. Now, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is out to ban Styrofoam food packaging in stores. It's actually not Styrofoam technically, it's plastic foam. He's looking to ban that in stores and food restaurants. Bloomberg will unveil the plan today in his final State of the City speech.
SAMBOLIN: And, boy, did you feel that breeze? Look at this. A boxer has suspended for allegedly taking a dive 13 seconds into a fight against former NFL defensive end Ray Edwards. Look at this, the phantom upper cut misses his much smaller opponent Nick ""Turbo Tax"" Capes by about a foot. But he sells it, literally knocking himself off his own feet. Reports say ""Turbo Tax"" --
BERMAN: That is insane, I'm sorry. It is nowhere near him.
SAMBOLIN: I know. But it looked right. So, if you're far away.
BERMAN: Two miles away.
SAMBOLIN: ""Turbo Tax"" was a last-minute replacement for a couple of no-show boxers. North Dakota's fight governing body is reviewing that right there. It won't take long to jump into a conclusion dare, I say, right?
BERMAN: Not a tough one to review. Everyone waking up to a huge business story, a massive deal in the airline industry. U.S. Airways and bankrupt American Airlines have agreed to a merger.
SAMBOLIN: But what does it mean for you, the flier? Christine Romans has details in ""Road Warriors"".
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Because it's all about us in the end, isn't it? The goal is a more efficient, more profitable airline, but that's going to take some time. Airline mergers generally take a few years, so for now get ready for some logistical headaches. One analyst we talked to says the bigger the merger, the more problems there are. First, combining the computer systems isn't easy. So, there could be some reservation problems initially. We can look at one of the most recent mergers for a clue. United and Continental -- in January, 2012, the first month the government combined data of those carriers, it showed customer complaints shot up 198 percent. Most of the complaints are about flight problems, cancellations, delays and reservations and ticketing problems. These two airlines also have to combine their frequent flier programs. They're going to have to woo back business travelers that American lost with all of those canceled flights this fall because of a pilot sickout. Here's travel expert Mark Murphy on some of the benefits of the deal.
MARK MURPHY, TRAVEL EXPERT: This merger will provide the traveler with better connections. I think you're going to be in nine major hubs between the two carriers now with the merger. So you're going to be able to get where you want to go more efficiently and effectively.
ROMANS: All right. So those nine major hubs are all over the country giving people a lot of access. Look at where they are. Not a lot of overlap. Really the only overlap in Chicago and Phoenix. Because of that and because the economy is still weak, many travel experts are telling us that ticket prices probably won't go up. Now, we should also point out that sources close to the boards have told us that the boards have agreed there's a lot of work to do here. An announcement today likely and then we'll wait to se what the bankruptcy judge says and what federal regulators say about this big, big deal.
BERMAN: Usually changes need to be made before it's finalized but they manage to push it through.
ROMANS: That's right. Absolutely.
SAMBOLIN: John pointed out perhaps they could double our miles. So --
ROMANS: No details on your frequent flier plan but I will find out as soon as this deal is official.
SAMBOLIN: We appreciate that. Thank you. All right. Nineteen minutes past the hour. Coming up, lots of folks watching the news of that Carnival cruise ship limping back to port today. Christine Romans is coming back to tell us what you need to know if you are holding tickets for a cruise."
CNN-229050,"MICHAELA PEREIRA, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Medical professionals remain shocked that a 15-year-old boy can survive a 5- 1/2 hour flight from California all the way to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767. Although it is very rare, the teen would not be the first to live through this kind of journey. Back in 2000, a man survived a 7-1/2-hour flight from Tahiti to Los Angeles in the wheel well of a plane. Joining me now is the very physician who successfully treated that stowaway, Dr. Armand Dorian. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to have you here. Why don't you describe to us the condition of the stowaway survivor that presented to you in the E.R. back in 2000?
DR. ARMAND DORIAN, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL: Back in 2000, the patient that rolled in by paramedics was not in the same state as this young boy this year. He was literally frozen, almost cartoonishly frozen. His arms were kind of jutted out. He was moaning. He was unconscious. He was not alert. We had to do multiple critical measures to keep him alive. His core body temperature was below 80 degrees. We had to intubate him, put chest tubes in. It was really touch and go.
PEREIRA: It was really a miracle that he survived in your estimation?
DORIAN: There's no question. I thought in my lifetime I would never even hear of another case like this, let alone hear of a case where the gentleman who was a stowaway walks away from the incident.
PEREIRA: Let's get to that. You already compared the difference between that. Quickly, before we move on, do you know if that man had lasting side effects? Oftentimes you don't know the results many years later. Do you know?
DORIAN: Actually he had no gross motor dysfunction, so something may actually be -- later on that may come up like depression, chronic headaches, but nothing obvious at the time when he was discharged from the hospital. Know that it was a month after he was admitted.
PEREIRA: Interesting. OK, to this 15-year-old, he essentially after an hour after the plane landed sort of came out of the wheel well mostly able to move on his own power. This is phenomenal. Talk to me about what you think happened that this young man would present in a very different condition than the man in 2000.
DORIAN: I mean, the planets all were aligned. This was a perfect storm of disaster that actually probably saved his life because when the airplane ascends, you lose oxygen, the air gets thin as we would say in layman's terms. You would pass out in about a minute after being up there. Also, the temperature drops. With the temperature dropping it actually starts slowing down your body's need for oxygen. It puts you in a frozen or some people termed it as a suspended state. Kind of like a cryogenic freezing that we've seen, you know, sci-fi or hear about in the future happening and because your demand decreases, you don't need as much oxygen. You can be suspended in time until your oxygen is replenished.
PEREIRA: We know your patient passed out and doesn't remember a thing of his flight. We don't what this young boy remembers. We know that he did tell police that he was unconscious for a time. What do you think it feels like for all of this to go on or do we know that because most people don't have a memory of it?
DORIAN: I'm pretty sure he's not going to have any memory or recollection of it. He's going to probably remember the adrenaline rush of trying to hide inside that wheel well, the beginning of that takeoff, and then about a minute max, 5 minutes after that takeoff he's unconscious. The next thing he remembers, he's waking up and he's landed already. Maybe he thinks he didn't take off. He passed out and is in a completely different place.
PEREIRA: How unusual is it, Dr. Dorian, for a person to survive subzero temperatures, lack of oxygen for 5-1/2 hours and also that he didn't fall out of the landing gear.
DORIAN: I kind of describe it as winning the lottery five times in a row. The fashion in which he did it, I would think it was a poor TV show production if they had a kid walk out of a wheel well like this. It's really mind-boggling.
PEREIRA: The story he was telling us, he was trying to get home to Somalia to see his mother. You can imagine the heartbreak. You can imagine the concern the family has. Hopefully he'll get medical attention to deal with any issues that come up after this. Dr. Dorian, what a pleasure to talk to you. Some miracles stories we are talking about. Thanks for joining us from Los Angeles -- Chris.
CUOMO: That just does not make sense. I don't know how that kid managed to not have any effects of such extreme conditions. Let's take a little break on NEW DAY to consider it. When we come back, an object of interest on the shoreline of Western Australia. Could it be debris from Flight 370?
BOLDUAN: The death toll continues to rise in the South Korean ferry disaster. Why did so many victims fail to get out alive? We'll take you inside a simulator to get a better understanding of the life-or- death emergency at sea."
CNN-239067,"BERMAN: Tensions building in Scotland this morning and much of the United Kingdom as voters get ready for an historic vote on whether to split from the rest of the United Kingdom. Tomorrow's vote could see Scots declare independence, potentially splitting up Great Britain after 300 years. Now, some U.K. officials in Britain are pledging to give Scots new powers in an effort to sway a vote against independence. I want go to Max Foster right now who has the latest from Edinburgh. And, Max, these polls are so, so close.
MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, three out today, John, and they're all too close to call. And you can really tell the story here from Edinburgh, by looking at the front pages of the newspapers. So, one of the polls on ""Scotsmen"" saying the polls has ""no"" in the land. But actually the ""yes"" campaign is closing the gap. And ""The Herald"", the only newspaper in Scotland supporting the ""yes"" campaign, is making the point that yes the pro-independent campaign is closing the gap and has the momentum and could overtake no by tomorrow. That's the suggestion, at least. Very clear on the front of ""The Daily Mail"", 24 hours to save Britain or to go independent. It really is a date with destiny tomorrow. We talked a bit about how there's a lot of attention to the run-up to tomorrow's poll. You know, this has been two years of campaigning and a lot of aggression, particularly on the yes side. And a very simple message here, keep the heat and carry on. That's the Scottish play on keep calm and carry campaigning, and to keep things calm really, because it is pretty tense here at the moment.
BERMAN: Max, I think we have about a thousand questions here in the United States for you about this referendum. Can't possibly ask them all the time we have. But let me ask one that I think is surprising to many Americans. Scots want independence, they want to break away. But they want to keep the queen. They want to keep the monarchy. It seems as if they don't quite under this independence thing.
FOSTER: I think this is a huge thing for the queen. I mean, she only came close to commenting. She can't get involved in politics. You know, she has to stay above politics. That's her constitutional rule. But she did say to a churchgoer recently she really hope that Scots consider this. You can imagine there was a very big British empire. Empires come and go. And the empire's really been cut back, of course. But now, you're talking about home turf, and her home state being split. I think she's pretty concerned about this. We have to say, in all essence, we're not talking about a big change in her role in Scotland, because the yes campaign they do want to keep her as head of state. But I certainly think that she's concerned about what's happening here. A breakup of the U.K., it's a huge moment in British history.
BERMAN: It would be colossal, after more than 300 years, that vote is tomorrow. If they do vote to split, it would take 18 months to implement. Max Foster, great to have you here for us this morning. Thanks so much.
ROMANS: Big questions before the referendum of what a yes vote could mean for both economies. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told me there are a lot of unknowns, the biggest being currency.
KENNETH ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: When you got through with this divorce, suddenly you don't have the currency. What currency do you have? That's one of the first questions people will have, it's one of the first questions investors have. You really don't have an answer. They say it's the pound. The British say it's not the pound. People say, well, maybe Scotland will join the euro. That creates a lot of problems for the rest of the eurozone. And they could have their own currency, but that's not a magic elixir when you don't have long credibility.
ROMANS: It's a really big deal. Rogoff also said a yes vote could be -- maybe good for Scotland in the long run, he said like in a hundred years. But it's the short term uncertainly that is so concerning about this. He said, basically, it would be a mild negative for the U.K. and very big -- very big negative for Scotland. He also said, look, when Americans say why does this matter to me? I've heard this, why do I care? He says, because the U.K. and U.S. have the strongest alliance in the world. And this is our best friend breaking apart. It's a very big deal.
BERMAN: It has huge implications for international relations as well. Again, what do you do to every other separatist movement in the world?
ROMANS: To say nothing of America's nuclear position in northern Europe, it's in Scotland.
BERMAN: Fascinating. It will all be decided tomorrow. Twenty-seven minutes after the hour. Could U.S. troops end up fighting on the ground against ISIS? A new warning from a top U.S. general as there is skepticism now about the president's plan to battle the terrorists. We're live next."
