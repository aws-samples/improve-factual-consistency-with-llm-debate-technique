Debater expert_debater_sonnet_v3 argument for round 2<argument>The interview clearly shows that the use of multiple drugs together, including the anesthetic Propofol, outside of a hospital setting is not recommended. The doctor states that the combination of sedatives found in Jackson's system, including Propofol, was <quote>"Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes."</quote> He explicitly warns that <quote>"Propofol should not be used in home settings"</quote> and requires monitoring vital signs in a hospital, which did not occur here. The large quantity of Propofol found also raises concerns, as the doctor says it could keep someone sedated for up to 2 months. The evidence strongly supports that using these drugs together outside medical supervision was extremely dangerous and inadvisable.</argument>Debater expert_debater_mixtral_8_7B argument for round 2<argument>The interview reveals that Michael Jackson was in good health overall, as stated by Dr. Zeev Cain, head of the Anesthesiology Department at the University of California, Irvine: <quote>"Based on what I've heard previously, I expected to see more signs of chronic illness in his organs, more signs of an addict. They are not really there. He was basically healthy."</quote>. However, the autopsy report showed that several drugs, including sedatives and anesthetics, were found in Jackson's system. Dr. Cain confirmed that <quote>"Several drugs, Midazolam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Lidocaine, Epinephrine and Propofol"</quote> were in Jackson's body, and these were <quote>"Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes."</quote>. Therefore, the most factually consistent summary is that, despite Jackson's good health, the sedatives and anesthetics in his system stopped his breathing and led to his death.</argument>Debater expert_debater_sonnet_v3 argument for round 3<argument>My opponent's argument overlooks the key evidence that using Propofol and multiple sedatives together outside of a hospital is extremely dangerous and inadvisable, regardless of Jackson's health. The doctor clearly states that <quote>"Propofol should not be used in home settings"</quote> and requires monitoring vital signs, which did not occur. He confirms the drug combination was <quote>"Certainly enough to make sure that he stopped breathing, yes."</quote> Jackson's overall health is less relevant than the fact that improper, unsupervised use of these drugs caused his death, as the doctor warns <quote>"You have to monitor somebody's blood pressure, heart rate, how well they are breathing. You have to monitor their oxygen level.
